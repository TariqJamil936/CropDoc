"""Vision Agent: diagnoses a leaf photo DIRECTLY with a vision-capable LLM.

This is the primary diagnosis engine — the LLM looks at the actual photo and
forms its own open-set judgment (not constrained to any fixed class list).
The local ResNet9 CNN (backend.models.resnet9) is a secondary signal only:
it was trained on just 38 specific crop-disease classes with no "unknown"
option, so treating its output as ground truth meant any other plant got
confidently force-fit into the closest wrong class, with nothing ever
looking at the actual image to catch it. It's now used only to (a) offer a
second, independent data point for comparison and (b) drive the Grad-CAM
visualization, pointed at whichever of its 38 classes best matches the LLM's
diagnosis (via knowledge-base fuzzy matching) rather than blindly at its own
top guess."""

    "How to identify plant_species — always commit to your single best specific guess, e.g. "
    "\"Soybean\", \"Grape\", \"Bell Pepper\", \"Corn (maize)\", using leaf shape (ovate/lobed/compound), "
    "margin (smooth/serrated/toothed), venation pattern, and leaflet arrangement, the same way a "
    "botanist would from a clear leaf photo alone. Only answer \"Unknown\" if the leaf is so "
    "cropped, obstructed, or generic-looking that even an expert botanist genuinely could not "
    "narrow it past 'broadleaf plant' — this should be rare for a clear, well-lit, full-leaf photo. "
    "A confident-looking but possibly-wrong specific guess (reflected honestly via a lower "
    "confidence score) is far more useful than defaulting to \"Unknown\".\n\n"
    "How to identify disease_name — always name the specific disease or pathogen your visual "
    "evidence points to (e.g. \"Bacterial Blight\", \"Bacterial Pustule\", \"Septoria Brown Spot\", "
    "\"Powdery Mildew\", \"Early Blight\"), reasoning from lesion shape (angular/circular/irregular), "
    "border (whether it's bounded by leaf veins), color pattern (halos, concentric rings, pustules), "
    "and distribution across the leaf. Do NOT fall back to a generic category label like \"Leaf Spot "
    "Disease\", \"Fungal Infection\", or \"Leaf Blight\" as your final answer — those are diagnostic "
    "categories, not diagnoses. If you're genuinely torn between 2-3 specific candidates, name your "
    "single best one in disease_name and mention the runner-up(s) in explanation, again using "
    "confidence to reflect the uncertainty rather than vagueness in the name itself.\n\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- Never invent a confidence score you can't justify from what's actually visible — a specific, "
    "lower-confidence guess is correct behavior; a vague, evasive answer is not.\n"
    "- If the photo is too blurry, dark, distant, or obstructed to identify anything at all, set "
    "image_quality_ok to false, describe the issue, and keep confidence low rather than guessing — "
    "but a clear, in-focus, well-lit leaf filling the frame is NOT a reason to hedge.\n"
    "- If the plant is healthy, severity is \"Healthy\" and treatment fields should focus on "
    "maintenance rather than being left blank."
